# Roadside Assistance - "Pull Over"

Pull Over is an application where Users post problems they are having on the road for nearby users to assist them.

- Utilized Ruby on Rails to rapidly develop and deploy application using MVC framework
    - Here is the [Rails-Backend](https://github.com/zerminaejaz/pull_over_backend)
- Used JWT authorization to secure a single flow of data and helped verify the user by checking request signatures
- Utilized React MapBox GL with Geolocation API to render an interactive map for users to visualize what posts are nearby
and generate a specific Google Map search query
- Implemented React.js to create reusable UI components and increase app flexibility for future additions
- Utilized Redux to create a single source of truth while handling multiple concurrent forms for submission.
- Designed the User Interface with Bulma CSS Framework and Javascript to create a modern, smooth UI
